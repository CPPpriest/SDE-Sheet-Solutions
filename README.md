# SDE Sheet Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to the SDE sheet problems curated by GeeksForGeeks.   
This repository contains detailed solutions to the practice problems aimed at aspiring software developers who are preparing for interviews or improving their coding skills.

## About the SDE Sheet

The SDE sheet by GeeksForGeeks is a comprehensive collection of problems that are commonly asked in interviews for software development roles.   
These problems cover various areas of computer science, including data structures, algorithms, and system design.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific category of problems:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

Inside each folder, you will find the solutions in C++ which include both the code and a brief explanation of the approach.
